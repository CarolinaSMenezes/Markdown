# Markdown Introduction  
Markdown is a user-friendly markup language that lets you format text with headers, lists, and other elements. With Markdown, you write plain text using a simplified syntax, reducing complexity and saving time.   
Create portable Markdown files with the .md extension that work across tools and operating systems. Markdown is widely supported on platforms like GitHub and Reddit. You can also use Markdown editors to automatically convert .md files into formats such as PDF or HTML.  
Get started:
- [Create headers](./markdown_headers.md)  
- [Apply text styling](./markdown_text_styling.md)
- [Create Lists](./markdown_lists.md)
