# Welcome to the Markdown Project!
  
This project demonstrates my technical writing skills and knowledge of the Markdown markup language. The goal is to create a concise guide that introduces Markdown and explains some of its key features. Through this project, I have applied both my technical writing abilities and Markdown formatting knowledge to create a clear documentation.

## [Get started](./table_of_contents.md)
You can navigate the documentation using the links in the Table of Contents. Each section explains the syntax and provides examples to help you understand how to use it effectively. In this guide, you will learn:
- What Markdown is
- How to create headers and lists
- How to format text using Markdown
